This is an experiment which examine force law of the following form
F(r) = A/r^n + C*r 

We measured force for r = 0.5 to 3 with 5 intervals
Name of each observable is 'F' followed by value of r
i.e. F0.5 = Force at r = 0.5

We have set the correct value to be
A = 1, n=2 and C = 1.25
"Experimental result" is generated by running the formula with such A and C
"Model result" is generated by running the model at A, n and C chosen at random. 

We have added an absolute error of +/-0.01 to both the experimental result and model result
