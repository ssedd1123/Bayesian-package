This is an experiment where the theory tells us
F = sin A cos 2C

The name of the observable is F1, and we have the correct value to be
A = 0.25 and C = 0.25
"Experimental result" is generated by running the formula with such A and C
"Model result" is generated by running the model at A and C chosen at random.

We have added an absolute error of +/-0.01 to both the experimental result and model result
