This is an experiment which examine model of the following form
F = A*sin(sqrt(A^2 + B^2))

We have set the correct value to be
A = 1, C = 0.25
"Experimental result" is generated by running the formula with such A and C
"Model result" is generated by running the model at A, n and C chosen at random. 

We have added an absolute error of +/-0.01 to both the experimental result and model result
